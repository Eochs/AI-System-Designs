# Content Detection System

## Problem:
* Spam, scams, and abusive content have been increasing on all major platforms (TODO: add citation)
* Cannot scale a team of analysts to manually check every piece of content.

## Goals: 
* Detect bad content such as Spam, Abuse, and other violations of ToS. 
* Scrub the content from the site _as soon as possible_.
  * Reduce time needed for analyst to evaluate content.
  * Limit False Positives so analyst is not overwhelmed 

Based on this will build a recommender of possible violations that should be looked at by analysts. 
TODO: image of recommender system with dashboard describing why content is flagged.

## Data:
Target Variable: whether an analyst explicitly flags the recommended violation. Negative is explicit or implicit if they ignore the recommendation.
